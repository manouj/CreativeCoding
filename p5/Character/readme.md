#### Project by: Manouj Kumar
#### Term: Fall 18

This character was created as the first deliverable of the Creative coding class CIM 640.
I created a sketch of a car using shapes in p5js. Interactions include acceleration of the car, paint job, and toggling lights

## Inputs
**1. Acceleration:** Move the mouse in x-axis to increase/decrease acceleration of the car.
a. Move the mouse left to decrease acceleration.
b. Move the mouse right to increase acceleration.

**2. Paint Job:** Pick a color from the color palette to change the color of the car.
